**Note**: 

**1. BTC Volume Data from CMC**: Using API provided by [Coinmarketcap](https://coinmarketcap.com/api/documentation/v1/#) would lead to high subscription cost. Although other sources such as [coingecko](https://www.coingecko.com/en/api) and [cryptocompare](https://min-api.cryptocompare.com/documentation?key=Historical&cat=dataExchangeSymbolHistoday) offer free APIs, the exchange volume they offer does not include on-chain transaction volume. So we simply copy-paste historical data from Coinmarketcap to Microsoft Excel to get CMC.csv for research purpose only. 

**2. BTC Data from CM"**: we found the easiest way to import data from CM is using its [Github Repo CSV LINK](https://github.com/coinmetrics-io/data/blob/master/csv/btc.csv)

**3. UTXO Age** : calculated from data queried from Google Bigquery public datasets: bigquery-public-data.crypto_bitcoin
